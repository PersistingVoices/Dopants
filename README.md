Dopants
=======

*   Dr.K's project on iterating through different dopants, into the current crystallographic structures.
    All the scripts on here are to support the ease with which one can iterate though them.
    This is initially a project with automation in mind.
    
*   The project primarily operates on CRYSTAL. All dependencies have to be installed, as well as the full lic. 
    of the project must be posessed by the person in order for it to execute.

*   The structures are highly computationally intensive to calculate, hence it is not recommended to run on 
    a simple arch. 

*   You will find the exercises to make one's life simpler as well.
