#Crystallised - A Tutorial Project 

-	**This tutorial can also be personalised. By combining personal application with the general framework, one can work quickly and effectively.
	**
-	**This is not to say that one has to be limited to one application/task, but many such templates can be made, which can then be further modified.** 

- 	** For the sake of simplicity, all the tasks provided here are the ones pertaining to my assignment, and how they were executed.**

- 	** A final package with all the tools necessary to make more tutorials will also be provided.** 

---
## Architecture:

-	 The website as of now is designed to be simplistic, adopting a Skeleton \r framework. 
-	 Estimated date of completion of a __full skeletal framework +  content : 20.07.2015__
- 	 Further customisation and content support would be supplied henceforth.


---
## Content:

## An Introduction to CRYSTAL

-	Provide an explaination of the task at hand  (in my case what I have done)
-	Provide a short explaination the sofware, its origins (how fun! -_- but important) and its application.
-	Provide information of what the user is going to do. This can be __whatever__	

## Installation

### Windows, Mac 
- 	There must be some sort of a script or a .exe for these widely distributed OS. 
- 	Provide links for these and porvide screenshots for this kind of installation process (successful ones)
-	Provide links to FAQ's as well. 
### Linux 
- 	Recommend installation of Debian/Ubuntu 
- 	Provide the list of dependencies installed in a common system.
- 	Provide installation scipts. 
- 	Provide execute instructions. 
 	
## Examples or Background reading?

-	Examples ofcourse! 
- 	Execute your first file,  click on link download the Mgo.d12 file, (*or make a dependant folder that they can download as 
	a whole* )

##Personalisation

-	From here, every tutorial designed should be different.  
-	From here, I will concentrate on the current task.

NOTE TO SELF
---
-	This serves 2 purposes:
	- This will provide a method by which I can gauge the learning curve. 
	- This may also provide some niche details.

#### Example 1 - simple case

From ICSD to geometry input
Exercise to make prim cell with 16,32...
The bulk (conventional, primitive)
Creating a Super Cell
Symettry and Geo editing
Removal, +, -, sub and disp of atoms
2D input, slab model
Example 2 - Molecular Crystal: urea
From Crystallograpic data to the Crystal geo input
The bulk structure
From bulk to molecules
Other useful keywords

						Misc

	*look into the 'inotifywait' thing 

 'inotifywait -q -m -e CLOSE_WRITE --format="git commit -m 'autocommit on change' %w" file.txt | sh'
	
	*make a smiliar script to the above, simpler in execution (or more lines, whichever makes more sense).
	
	*make a pusher, to master 'as root'?
	*look into the summing thing, add, commit and push that using the above script. 
		* you should be asked the file name, the commit message, and the option to push it.
		* ENCODE <--> CONVERT TO C <--> 
	*LOOK INTO THE PLOTTER.
	*LOOK INTO OpenGL and possibly apply it to plotter.
